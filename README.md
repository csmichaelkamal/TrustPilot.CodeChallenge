### How to Calculate the location of the Object (Pony, Domokun or EndPoint)
The location is the number of cells from the beginging till the location itself.
For Example: if the Pony's location is 121 and the Maze Dimention is 15 * 25 (Width * Height),
then to get the location, you should do the following:
1. Divide 121 / 15 (Maze's width) = 8.066666 (8 here indicate the whole rows before the exact location)
2. Subtract the number before the decimal point, so it will be 0.066666
3. Multiply it with the maze width (15), the result is 1
4. The Pony's location is in the 9th row and the 2nd column ((.0666666 * 15) + 1)
